Mbed code used for USB HID Interface. 

Also hosted on:
https://developer.mbed.org/users/jofo/code/WoodenHapticsHID/

The WoodenHapticsHID folder is an export from the above url using
the mbed compilers export utility, and specifying qtcreator as toolchain.
Qtcreator only facilitates coding, make utility is enough.
To build locally:

make

Note: you may need the gcc-arm compiler

NOTE: We provide the binary here as well, just drag and drop to your mbed
in order to use it!

Latest version is the WoodenHapticsHID.bin

work with with chai3d-3.0.0-woody with (2016-12-12) commit.
