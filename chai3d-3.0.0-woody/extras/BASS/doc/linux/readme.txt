BASS installation instructions
------------------------------


In order to use the BASS shared library on Linux, a little bit of configuration is required. The following instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 13.04 (64-bit), but should apply to most recent linux distributions with minimal changes (if any).


1. install the libbass.so shared library

The libbass shared library must installed on your system. The 'linux-installation.sh' script will take care of that for you.
